## Exercise 3.12

__This problem involves simple linear regression without an intercept.__

a. __Recall that the coefficient estimate $\beta^{0}$ for the linear regression of Y onto X without an intercept is given by (3.38). Under what circumstance is the coefficient estimate for the regression of $X$ onto $Y$ the same as the coefficient estimate for the regression of $Y$ onto $X$?__

b. __Generate an example in R with $n=100$ observations in which the coefficient estimate for the regression of $X$ onto $Y$ is different from the coefficient estimate for the regression of $Y$ onto $X$.__

c. __Generate an example in R with $n=100$ observations in which the coefficient estimate for the regression of $X$ onto $Y$ is the same as the coefficient estimate for the regression of $Y$ onto $X$.__
