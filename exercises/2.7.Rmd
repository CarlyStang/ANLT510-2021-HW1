## Exercise 2.7

__Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for Y when X1 = X2 = X3 = 0 using K-nearest neighbors.__

a. __Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, X1 = X2 = X3 = 0.__

<!-- enter your solution here -->

b. __What is our prediction with $K = 1$? Why?__

<!-- enter your solution here -->
    
c. __What is our prediction with $K = 3$? Why?__

<!-- enter your solution here -->
    
d. __If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly nonlinear, then would we expect the best value for $K$ to be large or small? Why?__
